# Customer360-Analysis
In this project, Customer 360 Analysis, we aims to provide a comprehensive view of customer behavior, preferences, and engagement through data-driven insights.

By integrating various data sources, we analyze critical customer metrics such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values to uncover key patterns and segment customers effectively. Leveraging advanced analytics techniques, including the IQR method and percentile ranking, we assign customer labels to create actionable insights. Further, we utilize the BCG Matrix to classify customers into meaningful segments such as VIP, Loyal & Potential, New, and Lost Customers.

The final analysis is visualized in Power BI, employing DAX Code to create interactive dashboards that showcase critical insights and trends for each customer group.
